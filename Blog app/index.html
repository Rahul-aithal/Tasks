                  <h5 class="card-title">Meta AI</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Large Language Models (LLMs), with OpenAI’s ChatGPT being the most prominent example, have gradually become integral to our daily lives. Meta, the company behind WhatsApp, has invested heavily in LLMs, aiming to revolutionize user experiences across its platforms. In a bid to stay ahead in the evolving market, WhatsApp has been exploring various ways to enhance its platform. In a recent move, the company has decided to integrate the power of generative AI into one of your most frequently used smartphone apps. In this post, let’s take a look at how you can access Meta’s new AI on WhatsApp, directly from the popular messaging application.

                    <br>
                    What is Meta AI? What Can It Do?
                    Meta AI, powered by Meta’s proprietary large language model (LLM), LLaMA 3, is now accessible on WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. This cutting-edge generative AI technology can be utilized within feeds, chats, and other features across Meta apps to generate content, explore topics in-depth, and accomplish tasks seamlessly without leaving the app.
                    <br>
                    On WhatsApp, Meta AI can respond to queries, provide detailed information, and have engaging conversations with users. The underlying LLM primarily generates the AI’s answers, but if it cannot find the required information, it can access the internet to retrieve it.
                    <br>
                    Meta AI is capable of engaging in casual conversations on a wide range of topics, offering comprehensive and informative answers while maintaining a friendly tone. It also acts as a search assistant, fetching relevant information from the web directly within the app, enhancing the user experience on WhatsApp.
                    <br>
                    Interestingly, it can also generate images based on your prompts. This feature is particularly useful since many online tools for image generation require a subscription. While it’s uncertain how long this feature will remain free, considering the entire model is public, it might stay free indefinitely.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">How Long Should a Laptop Computer Last?
<br>
                    There are several key factors laptop computer buyers will be considering as they pursue their purchase, and lifespan will be at or near the top of any such list. A key question often arises here: How long should a laptop computer last?
                    <br>
                    At PC Laptops, we offer a wide range of both desktop and laptop computers for sale to clients across the Salt Lake Valley, including from Riverdale and American Fork through Orem and all the way up to Salt Lake City. Lifespan is one of several important variables we discuss with clients as they search for the ideal laptop - here are some of the key factors that influence laptop lifespan, including those that pertain both to the machine itself and to the way it's used and maintained. 
                    <br>
                    Laptop Hardware
                    One of the single largest factors influencing laptop lifespan is the hardware included in the machine. Some of the most important hardware components for a laptop are:
                    <br>
                    Processor The processor or CPU (Central Processing Unit) is essentially the "brain" of your computer and handles all tasks from basic computing to more complex functions. A powerful processor can ensure your laptop will have a longer lifespan and be able to handle newer, more demanding software in the years to come.
                    <br>
                    Graphics Card: While not all laptops are designed for gaming or graphic design, if you do plan on using your laptop for these purposes it's important to invest in a quality graphics card. This will not only provide better performance but also prolong the lifespan of your laptop for these tasks.
                    <br>
                    Battery Another crucial component to consider is the battery. A high-quality, long-lasting battery can ensure that your laptop will continue to function well even after years of use.
                    <br>
                    Motherboard The motherboard is essentially the backbone of your laptop and dictates how all other components work together. A well-built motherboard can greatly contribute to the lifespan of your laptop.
                    <br>
                    Hard drive: Storage is another important factor to consider, and a solid state drive (SSD) can provide better performance and longevity compared to traditional hard drives.
                    <br>
                    Usage and Maintenance
                    Aside from hardware, there are several usage and maintenance factors that also play a role in determining the lifespan of a laptop. These include:
                    <br>
                    Operating system: Keeping your operating system up-to-date is crucial for the longevity of your laptop. Regular updates can improve performance and address potential security vulnerabilities.
                    <br>
                    Heat management: Overheating can greatly damage a laptop's hardware, so it's important to ensure proper ventilation and use cooling pads if necessary.
                    <br>
                    Cleaning Regularly cleaning your laptop, both internally and externally, can prevent dust buildup and help maintain optimal performance.
                    <br>
                    Power supply: Using a surge protector and avoiding power surges can protect the internal components of your laptop from damage.
                    <br>
                    Avoiding damage: Accidents happen, but being careful with your laptop and protecting it from drops, spills, and other physical damage can greatly extend its lifespan.
                    <br>
                    In addition to considering these factors when purchasing a new laptop, regular maintenance and updates can also help prolong the lifespan of an existing laptop. By taking care of both the hardware and software aspects of your machine, you can ensure that your laptop will last for many years to come. 
                    <br>
                    Storage
                    While this could technically be included within the usage category, storing your laptop properly when not in use can also contribute to its lifespan. This includes using a protective laptop bag or case, avoiding extreme temperatures, and being mindful of where you place the laptop (e.g. avoiding placing it in direct sunlight). Proper storage can prevent physical damage to the laptop and extend its lifespan.
                    <br>
                    Know Your Warranty
                    When purchasing a laptop, be sure to check the manufacturer's warranty and understand what is covered. Some warranties may include free repairs or replacement if hardware fails within a certain timeframe. It's also important to properly register your laptop and keep track of the warranty expiration date.
                    <br>
                    While there's no definitive answer to how long a laptop should last, considering these factors can help ensure that you make a wise investment and get the most out of your laptop. With proper care and maintenance, a quality laptop can last for many years and continue to meet your needs and expectations.
